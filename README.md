# Astrophysics-models-observations
Comparison between the model predicted intensity values of various species with their observed values.
# Code and resources
Python version: 3.9.9
Packages: aplpy, matplotlib
# Model Building
I used the .py script to compare modeled intensity values (colored dots) of CII with its observational values (colored curves) towards different regions of a star-forming region, RCW49. The thickness of the curves correspond to the observational error in these intensity values.
